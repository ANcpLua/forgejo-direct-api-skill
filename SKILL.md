# Forgejo Direct API

Use this skill for Forgejo-first work. Do not start from GitHub names unless the user explicitly asks for GitHub comparison.

## Rules

- Use live Swagger as authority: `<instance>/swagger.v1.json`.
- Use Forgejo names: repository, actions runner, workflow, run, task, pull request, review, issue comment, commit status, package, release, webhook.
- Prefer direct Forgejo API calls over wrappers or compatibility shims.
- Keep tokens out of logs and responses.
- Use `Authorization: token $FORGEJO_TOKEN` unless the instance documents another auth scheme.
- Treat ActivityPub endpoints as federation only; they are not part of qyl CI, review, package, or repo automation.

## Reference files

- `references/forgejo-api-map.md`: Forgejo-native endpoint map by task.
- `references/forgejo-v15-endpoints.md`: generated full v15 route inventory from live Swagger.
- `references/forgejo-actions-runner.md`: Actions workflow, runner, label, secret, variable, dispatch, and run/task notes.
- `references/forgejo-ai-review.md`: Forgejo-native AI review flow using pull request, review, issue comment, and status APIs.

## qyl private repo path

```text
GET /user
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}
authenticated git push
.forgejo/workflows/*.yml
runner label matches runs-on
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/tasks
```

## Refresh and verify

```bash
./scripts/fetch-forgejo-swagger.sh https://v15.next.forgejo.org
```

```bash
FORGEJO_TOKEN=... ./scripts/verify-forgejo-skill.sh https://v15.next.forgejo.org ANcpLua qyl
```

Without `FORGEJO_TOKEN`, verification still checks documented routes against Swagger and skips private repo probes.
